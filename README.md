## What is this?
Many moons ago on Telegram Whopper and I joked about having a huge blowout in Vegas when GET hits $5. This is the realisation of that joke.

## When is this?
Thursday 15th September 2022 until Sunday 18th September 2022.

## What needs to happen?
GET needs to be trading above $5 by 1st April 2022.

If it isn't weâ€™ll roll this over to the 3rd weekend of September 2023.

## Why $5?
Originally the $5 target was plucked out of thin air and over time this became $10. After some discussion, back-of-a-cig-packet mathematics and then a vote, we settled on $5.

More accurately, 1000 GET is the amount that people are willing to allocate to make this happen and it just so happens that $5000 stretches as far as it needs to.

Here are some rough costings used as a basis:
* **Flight**; $986 AMS - LAS round trip KLM. $1972 for 2 people.
* **Airport Transfers**; $17.50pp round trip. $35 for 2 people.
* **Hotel**; ~$1500 for 2 people, 7 nights.
	* Vdara (5*); $1434
	* NoMad (5*); $1588
	* ARIA (5*); $1664
* **Buffet**; $40 pp/night. $240 for two people three times.
* **Champagne Brunch**; $25 pp/brunch. $50 for two people once.
* **Incidentals**; $50 pp/day. $700 for 7 nights.
* **Big Night**; $500.

Adding all of that up takes us to a nice neat $4997 total for a week in Vegas for you and another in a 5-star hotel with most incidentals covered. All for the low low cost of 1000 GET.

These are of course rough estimates. You might wish to come alone and gamble like a mad man, or you might bring kids and stay by the pool the whole time. But it is fundamentally doable on $5000 and thatâ€™s the point. Tweak it to your pleasing.

## Why 1000 GET?
Weâ€™ve got to set our sights somewhere and this feels like the right amount without overburdening our stacks.

At the time of writing ($0.41/GET) you can pull this together for $410.

Or alternatively if you act as a liquidity provider for the [liquidity mining program](https://medium.com/get-protocol/the-get-liquidity-mining-program-55cc50c4bb7e) contributing 1% of the pool, this will take you 3 months to collect passively without any additional investment of your own. 1% of 32k GET monthly rewards would result in 320 GET per month. After 3 months you'd make 960, and the Uniswap fees you collect during this period would cover the rest.

## A week!?
I doubt it honestly. Most of us wonâ€™t have either the stamina or the urge. The costings cover a week because travelling from Amsterdam to Vegas wouldn't make sense for most. Weâ€™ll only plan for the above 3 nights together as a group and people can dip in and out as they please.

## What will we do?
Pretty much unplanned but letâ€™s suggest a nightly Vegas buffet and see where things go.
